        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am driven to learn and apply expertise to solve challenging problems and teach others. </p>
        <p>After I graduated with masterâ€™s degree in Biotechnology, I learned how essential cross function collaboration was in implementing concepts and turning them in to real products as Senior R&D Engineer at Nondestructive testing industry. </p>
        <p>I then moved to US where I took a role in the quality department at polymer manufacturing firm where I focused on growing my team and improving cross functional collaboration between sales, operations, logistics, and purchasing.</p>
        <p>Over the next 5 years, I not only grew to become the manager of the quality department, but also took on the role of Director of R&D creating recipes for thermoplastic elastomers. </p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoys exploring the wilderness, travelling, spending time with family and continuing to learn new skills.</p>
